Explanation of UX: 

The brand I am trying to communicate is “the .batra” which is the name of my page.
I have used a “.b” logo all around my site to communicate this. 
Moreover, I am looking for a software development job and so recruiters are 
my high value users. I have thus created a theme that is not too overpowering
with colors that are too bright and I have tried to keep my page professional 
and job oriented. I have added a dew interactive elements to my page. For example, 
each of the images fades when you hover over it and a caption appears. On the project
pages these images are also inside a lightbox display. Furthermore, to view my 
projects you can click on the “View my works tab” the can be toggled and expanded/
collapsed. 

To run this project, start at index.html and navigate anywhere you like! And if you find bugs or have feedback, feel free to shoot me an email at bbatra@ucsd.edu
